/* The task is to find their comparison points by comparing a[0] with b[0], a[1] with b[1], and a[2] with b[2].
 If a[i] > b[i], then Alice is awarded 1 point. If a[i] < b[i], then Bob is awarded 1 point. If a[i] = b[i], then neither person receives a point.
 Return output should be array with sore of a at index 0, score of b at index 1.
